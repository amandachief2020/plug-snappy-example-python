Trivial Python Snappy example
=============================

This is a trivial example of packaging up a Python executable for
Ubuntu Snappy Core using Snapcraft.

Building
--------

The package can be built by running "snapcraft" in the source
directory.  Alternatively, you can run "snapcraft stage" to stage the
package without producing the final executable.
